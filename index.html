    <p>It all started in 1992 when Harshad Mehta scam broke out and I started reading financial newspapers like The Economic Times.  These were the days, when stock market was not that accessible and trades were very opaque and difficult to execute.  After getting some basic knowledge, I started my investment journey when I bought my first few shares with a lot of excitement. In those days, there were very few brokers and that too in bigger cities, so we had to contact them personally and issue cheques to buy shares.  Shares were in physical form and not dematerialized and hence we had to face a lot of technical difficulties when placing orders.  That was really difficult time for investors and traders and technology had not caught up and orders were placed either on brokers terminal or through phone.</p>

<h3> Digital Revolution in Financial Markets</h3>  As computerization picked up pace in India, digitization of financial markets took place, which led to easy accessibility, greater transperancy in executing trade orders, and cost of investing and trading also went down considerably, which in turn led to more participation in the markets by the average middle class Indians. <br>
<h4>Big Market Capitalization Expansion</h4>  Due to large participation by global institutions as well as Indians, Stock market capitalization boosted to all time high.  Even today, Indian stock market capitalization is growing in leaps and bounds and more and more Indians are participating in this success story. <br>
<h5>My trading Debut</h5>
I deliberately took a slow start to my trading venture as I had no need to feed my family from my income as my family expenses were covered by my wife as she had a stable job.  She encouraged me to do trading, although she had very little knowledge of how things work in stock market.  When I started my trading, the cost of trading was very high and most traders traded in options as it had very low trading cost.  Since I had a humble beginning in my trading journey, I by and large traded in cash market and in very small quantity as my research told me to keep my earlier learning costs very low and I had very little spare capital anyway. <br> <h6>Learning curve</h6>  It took me almost 7-8 years to get a better sense of the market and I am still learning, but my annual profit and loss has turned positive for the past 2 years, although on a very small base, but now I think I am ready to do my full time trading with reasonable capital.
